An social media-type program that allows users to assign fun superlatives to their friends. For example, (Name) is mostl likely to (something comically absurd), in the same spirit as the superlatives assigned in a high school yearbook. Users can assign superlatives to other users, as well as view everyones profiles, containing personal information as well as all the superlatives other people have assigned them. New users can be added and old ones can be deleted. 

User information is read in from input.txt and any information needs to be in the following format:
```
Name
Age
Star sign
Likes
Dislikes
Number of Superlatives assigned

```
